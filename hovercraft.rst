This is a demo for Hovercraft! You can view it as a finished presentation
at http://regebro.github.com/hovercraft/


It's also useful as an example, in which case it's supposed to be read as
`source code <../_sources/examples/hovercraft.txt>`_.

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    hovercraft hovercraft.rst outdir

And then view the outdir/index.html file to see how it turned out.

If you are seeing this text, and not reading this as source code, you are
doing it wrong! It's going to be confusing and not very useful.

Use The Source, Luke! But first you probably want to read through the
official documentation at https://hovercraft.readthedocs.io/
